 * This interface defines interactions with a source code repository that uses a Source Code Management system (i.e. version control system).

 * An SCM:
 *  - Maintains a set of Commits (full details) that are uniquely identified with ChangeSets (metadata)
 *  - Has a "most recent commit" called its head
 *  - Can roll back the state of the repository to a particular Commit
 *  - Can return to the head
